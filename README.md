# ESILV - Seoul Bike Sharing
## About Dataset

- Rental bikes are currently introduced in many urban cities to enhance the mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern.

- The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

## Problem

- The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes. Thus we are in a regression problem.

## Techno Used during this project
- PYTHON
- JUPYTER
- SPYDER
- FLASK

## Conclusion

- Seoul people first use bikes rented for going to work and coming back home
- Linear Regression is the fastest model
- The best dataset is the number 2
- Bagging is providing the best r2 accuracy
